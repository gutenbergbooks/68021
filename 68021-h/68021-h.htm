<p class="dropcap">Here at Yale we are inclined to take things rather too much
for granted. We talk glibly of our traditions as something
everlasting, and forget that most of them originated in the vague
limbo of eighteen-ninety. We unconsciously consider the College
of to-day to be the same as our fathers knew, and so it is astonishing
to find in the musty pages of an old <span class="smcap">Lit.</span> an account of “the
more splendid entrances of Durfee, a building which is certainly
ornamental and whose rooms are spacious and elegant”.</p>

<p>For, in general, we have accepted our surroundings as a permanent
matter of fact, and have not stopped to analyze just why they
are as they are. Most of us hardly know the reason for our being
here at all. In our four years we are continually passing through
a series of changes—παντα ρει—everything is in a state of flux.
Our ideas and ideals, our opinions and our minds are ever changing,
developing, broadening. The Senior is the Freshman only
in that he is the unifying body in which during the four-year span
these many shifting thoughts have been welded together, and the
instant has in truth been made eternity. For the Freshman is
too engrossed with the business of becoming acclimatized, heeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
some publication or other activity, and making friends to have
much time for anything else. Towards the close of the spring
term he looks forward to Sophomore year with a certain relish.
Then is when he will do all that reading and extra study, that
plain living and high thinking, which he has planned. But, curiously
enough, Sophomore year brings with it new and unforeseen
petty distractions which devour the time at an incredible rate,
and leave no more room for contemplation than the year previous.</p>

<p>And so with the last half of the cycle: the two final years swing
by confusedly and bring us to the precipice of graduation, a charm
or two on our watch chain, a smattering of knowledge which we
may or may not find comforting, nothing more.</p>

<p>Our development has been somewhat of a hand to mouth affair.
We have learned certain unrelated facts about this and that, and
have sketchily attempted to piece them together. But ordinarily
they have not fitted, because we have not devoted enough sheer
intellectual effort to the analysis of our own ideas. We have not
the slightest conception of what we <i>believe</i>. We may have
learned to think with reasonable clarity, and our ideals may be
rather high, but we have built up no scheme of life, nothing by
which to live. Any philosophy or creed which we may possess
is, at best, vague, inchoate, and fragmentary.</p>

<p>This, as I have said, is because we have never searched our souls
with the cold, relentless light of reason in an attempt to understand
every fiber of our make-up, we have taken things for
granted, we have known only our exteriors, we have not known
ourselves.</p>

<p>And living thus almost entirely on the surface, we have
inevitably grown to think of a philosophy of life as hardly an
essential. “What need have I for all this truck about religion?”,
we ask frankly, for we have not yet been brought face to
face with the Truth that in order to realize our highest possibilities
we must be utterly dominated by an ideal. We wish to
move the world, but we have not yet been impressed with the
necessity of having a place to stand. We have not been convinced
that we must believe in something.</p>

<p>The whole question has seemed to be something ethereal, something
far removed from our own natural lives. Consequently we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
have been inclined to think of religion as little else but repression
and that its followers knew nothing either of happiness or of
life. They seemed to belong to a world apart—to a world that
was drab and unreal.</p>

<p>So Christianity has become the most forbidding word in the
language. Judging it by its present fruits—by a decadent church
and by sweaty Y.M.C.A. gymnasiums—we have pronounced it
to be woefully lacking. We have not seen that these are in reality
not fruits at all, but abortions, that although the church in its
present form has outlived its usefulness, the spirit which exists
in each one of us is as dominating now as it ever was, if only we
will open our hearts to it. We have never stopped to think these
questions through to their conclusion. We take untruths and
half-truths for granted, and allow misconceptions to pass current
without ever a sincere effort to get at the eternal strength of
things.</p>

<p>And so we hear men talk of humility, and we laugh at them.
We wish to assert ourselves, to express our own individuality,
and being humble seems to convey the very opposite. We look
upon it as something synonymous with servility, as a state of
grovelling self-abasement in which a man must sacrifice both his
personality and his self-respect.</p>

<p>We hear men talk of brotherly love and it seems to us a farce.
How could anybody pretend to care for everyone equally, to put
his closest friend and the man in the street in the same class?
What could be more unnatural, more hypocritical?</p>

<p>And again we hear men talk of self-surrender and we hate
them for it. Why should I surrender myself? I am I. I possess
my ideas and ideals, and these are enough. Why should
I not strive to realize them without any external aid, any “something
not myself”?</p>

<p>Thus we argue and thus we feel because we are repelled by
words whose meaning we do not really understand. Our minds
have never pried deeply enough to find the Truth that humility is
nothing mean, nothing subservient, but rather the natural consciousness
of reverence before everything beautiful and sacred
in the universe. We have thought the ideal of brotherly love
to be futile because we have looked upon it only superficially.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
We have not realized that instead of a mere question of surface
like or dislike, it involves a tremendous tolerance and sympathy
with all of mankind, and that although difficult, if not impossible,
to attain in its fulness, it certainly is the antithesis of hypocritical.
We have loathed the very sound of self-surrender because we
have taken the word in its cold and literal sense, and have not
understood that instead of sacrificing any trace of individuality
in giving ourselves up to the spiritual and the ideal, we find instead
a new fulness and depth to life. For self-surrender is actually
a self-realization more compelling than our brightest dreams.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>Abbé Pierre.</i> By <span class="smcap">Jay William Hudson.</span> (D. Appleton &amp; Co.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">“Abbé Pierre”, by Jay William Hudson, is altogether a
delightful and charming book. It may not be called very
subtle, nor humorous, nor dramatic, nor sordid—qualities which
most modern novels seem to imbibe; but that it is delightful and
charming no one may deny.</p>

<p>In one respect the book is a picture of a Gascon village—its
customs and its traditions, its thoughts and its dreams. These
walks with Abbé Pierre along the dusty roads of Gascony, these
glimpses of its hills and valleys, these insights into its daily life
are most interesting and picturesque. Furthermore, such a background
is ideal for the unfolding of the romance of Germaine
Sance and the young American, David Ware.</p>

<p>In another respect the book is a picture of life viewed broadly
and sympathetically. Abbé Pierre left his little Gascon village
when he was quite young; he has given the best of his years and
strength to the world; and now he returns to spend his last days
in this place that he loves above all else. Here he sits in his
garden house and writes down some thoughts and ideas about
life born of many years of living. And these thoughts of his
give the book, along with its beauty of description, its beauty of
spirit.</p>

<p>I wish that all of us who aimlessly rush about this world with
no time to read anything but an “exciting” novel would pause and
read this book. I suppose my wish is ludicrous, for does not
Abbé Pierre himself say that “Americans always seem to think
that unless one is bustling about all the time one is doing nothing”?
And then he immediately adds: “Some of the best deeds that I
have ever done have been the thoughts I have lived through in
this same old garden by the white road, where wooden shoes go
up and down”. He who can appreciate such a philosophy will
read “Abbé Pierre” with much interest and delight.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>Confessions of an Old Priest.</i> By <span class="smcap">Rev. S. D. McConnell</span>. (The
MacMillan Co.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">We are all, being students, in a period when our opinions are
forming rapidly according to our characters and interests.
For those who feel that a religious philosophy is an essential basis
from which other values must be derived, or for those whose
religion is an untouched field of inherited beliefs and inhibitions,
the time and the subject-matter of “Confessions of an Old Priest”
are ripe. The Rev. Mr. McConnell remains in the end as devout
a Christian as he was fifty years ago, when he entered the Church
convinced that “it owed its origin to Jesus Christ, and that He was
the unique Son of God”. But he is no longer a worshipper of
Jesus; he has taken the very cornerstone out of Christian doctrine
and cast it away—and the edifice still shelters him as efficaciously
as before.</p>

<p>The volume is devoted to his explanation of this paradox: how
he finds himself a faithful Christian still, while the result of his
historical research has disproved for him the divinity of Jesus.
For Jesus, he declares, was not the original Christ; <i>Christus</i>, a
Greek word, was applied to the heroes of a number of Mystery
religions during the century before the obscure Hebrew province
of Gallilee had any intimations that the “Messiah” was born.</p>

<p>And the most startling attack upon traditional dogma is his
analysis of “the trouble with Christianity”. “It is,” he says, “not
an unworthy Christianity, but an unworthy Christ.” When the
reader has swallowed hard for a moment over that declaration,
he reads on to discover what this astounding pastor means, and
finds a wealth of plausible argument to support his extravagance
of phrase. Jesus himself preached a “workless” doctrine, a “toil
not, nor spin” existence, a “turn the other cheek” attitude, and it
is his biographers, together with such followers as Paul, who have
incorporated Him into the practical philosophy and morality of
the Church, to make Him the greatest exemplar in history of life
as it should be lived. Jesus, and “Christlike” people are delightful,
adorable characters, according to this book, but they are a
care to the community, and should their ethics be generally
adopted, civilization would go immediately more or less to smash.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. McConnell’s conclusions are so wholesale and
so radical that I am not sure we can all accept them without comment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
or refutation. I cannot agree with his method of discriminating
between true history and apostolic imagination in the
“synoptic” gospels. But I do think every Christian should read
this work as a test for his present beliefs and an introduction to
new areas of religious thought. And it is quite possible that
here is the way to a new religion and a satisfactory one in this
time of restlessness and agnosticism.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>What I Saw in America.</i> By <span class="smcap">G. K. Chesterton</span>. (Hodder &amp;
Stoughton, Ltd.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">After reading Mr. G. K. Chesterton’s account of his recent
travels in this country, we recalled to mind a certain cartoon
which appeared some time ago in a London periodical, which
depicted the author as an immense Zeppelin floating over the city.
From his mouth came great clouds of vapor and below were
written the words: “G. K. C. spreading paradoxygen over
London”. A similar caricature might be made in the present
instance, for the gentleman in question has, in this book, tinged
his treatment of America and American life with a shade of
paradox.</p>

<p>It would seem to us as if this most interesting and penetrating
series of essays should prove to be of greater interest to American
than to English readers. Mr. Chesterton came, saw, and pondered,
and the results of his meditations are a series of enlightening
essays dealing with everything in America and American life
from a discussion of what America is, and what manner of men
Americans are, to Prohibition and the Irish question.</p>

<p>The author never comments on any subject as you would expect
him to. His impressions of the material and the abstract, of
which we have formed no very definite opinion because of what
might be called that contempt bred of familiarity, come to us as
truths which are as worthy of our consideration as they merit
the laughter of the foreigner.</p>

<p>When he tells you that he is not sure that the outcome of the
Civil War may not have been for the best and that he believes
that Walt Whitman was the greatest American poet, you may be
inclined to disagree, but you will be forced to admit that, as he
himself would say, his reasons are reasonable. Nor does this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Englishman spare his own country in many of his comparisons.
The book is not one to be read through in a sitting; it is something
to be picked up and read one part at a time. There is none
of the parts but will bear a second and even a third reading, for
many of its truths are buried deep. It is a text-book in the art of
the appreciation of foreign lands, and its teachings, if followed,
would bring more lasting harmony among all peoples than the
League of Nations it condemns.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>Aaron’s Rod.</i> By <span class="smcap">D. H. Lawrence</span>. (Martin Secker.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Mr. Lawrence is undoubtedly the most consistent of the
so-called moderns on either side of the Atlantic. His
novels, thus far, have set an average standard far above that of
his closest rival, Mr. James Joyce. Mr. Lawrence’s books are
always readable; Mr. Joyce’s, seldom, but they both have gifts
of sincerity and mental acuteness which lift them from the ruck
of the ordinary incomprehensible. Their pungent observations
on types, existing conditions, and each other, are amusing to say
the least.</p>

<p>We have heard Mr. Lawrence’s name bandied promiscuously
about as a realist. Nothing could be less real than “Aaron’s Rod”.
The action and dialogue never took place on this earth, nor does
it seem probable that they ever will. There is an odd, pervasive
sense of violence saturating this novel. The Great War has evidently
left its stamp on the intellects of these younger British
geniuses, for their work has a tense, strained quality which is
disquieting in the extreme. The characters of “Aaron’s Rod”
move ceaselessly back and forth like a scurrying body of ants; they
jabber in a rather inhuman way about love, socialism, Italian
scenery, and Christmas trees.</p>

<p>There is no action, no story to speak of: A coal miner runs
off to London, thence to Italy, from one of the larger Midland
towns, for no reason whatsoever except that his wife is fond of
him. Persons appear on Mr. Lawrence’s stage, speak their lines,
and hurry off again, no one seems to know whither. Nevertheless,
these characters are interesting by virtue of Mr. Lawrence’s
positive genius for purely physical portraiture. Josephine, Aaron
Sisson’s first incidental “amoureuse”, is particularly well done,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
from a pictorial standpoint. Scarcely a page is given to her, yet
she leaves an impression on our minds far more lasting than that
of Aaron himself. Pains have been taken with Lady Franks in
the same way; it seems as if Mr. Lawrence loses interest in his
major characters. He must be on to pastures new.</p>

<p>“Aaron’s Rod” can scarcely be called a “good” novel. It contains
many advanced ideas in the field of sociology which we
found rather difficult to agree with. However, the world may in
time grow up to Mr. Lawrence and until then we should seize the
opportunity of reading his descriptions of luxurious interiors,
and the Alps. They are remarkably able bits of writing.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawrence is an important novelist now, but it is in his
power to do much better things than he has done so far. If he
would lessen his tone of violent indignation, if he would tincture
his spiritual realism a little less with impure physical realism, he
might be considered one of the great novelists of our time. As
it is, his achievement in “Aaron’s Rod” is remarkable in that he
has stripped off everything unnecessary, merely giving us the
essentials on just about every topic known as a “world problem”.
However, we should prefer the doses one at a time; all at once
they seem a rather large gulp.</p>

<p>This unique and fascinating collection of letters, written
1800-1851 by and to the first great American novelist and now
authoritatively edited by the novelist’s grandson, is printed from
originals in the possession of the Cooper family. As is well
known, Cooper, during his last illness, forbade the publication of
any biographical material about himself by his then living
descendants; and the biographical treatments, including even the
late Professor Lounsbury’s valuable work in the American Men
of Letters series, have necessarily been written without access
to any considerable body of first-hand evidence.</p>

<p>The publication of his intimate correspondence in the present
collection reveals an altogether more remarkable character than
has generally been conceived by even the most ardent twentieth-century
admirer of Cooper.</p>

<p>The letters tell of his life at Cooperstown, in Westchester
County, in New York City, and in various countries abroad.
The leading men of the time were among his correspondents—Washington
Irving, S. F. B. Morse, General Lafayette, Longfellow,
Bryant—and oftentimes their letters to Cooper are included
to make the story complete.</p>

<p>The two volumes constitute, not only an unique addition to
American biography, but also a profound and diverting commentary
on the social and family life of the novelist’s generation;
on the status of art, letters, and the always fascinating
business of writing, publishing, and selling books; on travel and
international relations; and on domestic politics through the
momentous decades when abolitionism was brewing in the North
and secessionism in the South. In fine, there is an overflowing
measure of all that one could look for, from the faint breath
of old church and family scandals up to the rousing melodrama
of Cooper’s long and triumphant legal campaign against newspapers.
And there is a great deal more for which one would
never think to look, grateful as one is to find it.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
